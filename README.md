# Stormy-2
This is a weather app that I'm trying to make that is having an error in the generated java and I cannot find a solution online
and have looked through my code and don't see any syntax errors. I've also tried deleting the idea/libraries folder and I've also
closed and reopened Android Studio and the error remains. The error is "cannot resolve symbol Weather" for the 
import edu.csteitz01bellarmine.stormy.Weather; in the generated databinding folder. If someone could run this code to see what the problem
is and point me to the source, I would greatly appreciate it.
